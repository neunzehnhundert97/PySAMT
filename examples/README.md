# Examples

In this directory you can find a collection of samples to demonstrate the different features of the framework. To use them, copy the python files **and** the configuration folder and fill in your bot token at the designated spot in the configuration file.


The following examples are currently available:

* **Echo:** A bot who will send back all received text messages.
* **Hello:** A bot who will greet the user when first connecting. It will ignore all other messages.
* **Media:** A bot capable of sending files and stickers.
* **Parsing:** A bot which can perform more complex matchings on incoming messages
